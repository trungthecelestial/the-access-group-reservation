This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Concept

This app is built with NextJS, Prisma connected to Planetscale (optional) and uses [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).
Normally we would have an User table to store info of the user but here to save time I put all data under one Appointment table.

## Getting Started

First, you need to create your `.env` from `.env.sample` file.

Then run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Deploy on Vercel

The app can be accessed via []().
